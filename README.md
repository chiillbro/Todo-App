- Created a simple ToDo App using React,
- Used useState hook to store and change the data dynamically based on the user input,
- created multiple components and reused them which reflects sole theme of React technology,
- In this Project, I used "Prop-drilling", try to experiment using <strong>useContext</strong> hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.
